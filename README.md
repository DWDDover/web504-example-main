### File Responsibilities

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `index.html` | Semantic HTML structure, no inline styles or scripts |
| `css/style.css` | All styling, responsive design, accessibility features |
| `js/app.js` | Application initialization, state management, component coordination |
| `js/firebaseConfig.js` | Firebase setup, configuration, upload/download functions |
| `components/uploadForm.js` | File selection, validation, upload with progress tracking |
| `components/imageGrid.js` | Gallery grid management, loading/empty states |
| `components/imageCard.js` | Individual image card creation and display |

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome 80+, Firefox 75+, Safari 13+, or Edge 80+)
- A text editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)
- A local web server (required for ES6 modules)
- A Firebase account (free tier is sufficient)

### Step 1: Get the Project

Clone or download this project to your local machine.

### Step 2: Set Up Firebase

1. **Create a Firebase Project**
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Click "Add project" or select an existing project
   - Follow the setup wizard

2. **Enable Firebase Storage**
   - In your Firebase project, click "Storage" in the left sidebar
   - Click "Get Started"
   - Choose "Start in test mode" (for development)
   - Click "Done"

3. **Get Your Configuration**
   - Click the gear icon ⚙️ next to "Project Overview"
   - Select "Project settings"
   - Scroll down to "Your apps"
   - Click the web icon `</>` to add a web app
   - Register your app with a nickname (e.g., "Image Gallery")
   - Copy the `firebaseConfig` object

4. **Update Configuration File**
   - Open `js/firebaseConfig.js`
   - Replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase configuration:
   ```javascript
   const firebaseConfig = {
       apiKey: "your-actual-api-key",
       authDomain: "your-project-id.firebaseapp.com",
       projectId: "your-project-id",
       storageBucket: "your-project-id.appspot.com",
       messagingSenderId: "your-messaging-sender-id",
       appId: "your-app-id"
   };
   ```

5. **Configure Storage Rules (Important!)**
   - In Firebase Console, go to Storage → Rules
   - For development/learning, use these test rules:
   ```
   rules_version = '2';
   service firebase.storage {
     match /b/{bucket}/o {
       match /{allPaths=**} {
         allow read, write: if true;
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   - **Warning**: These rules allow anyone to read/write. For production, implement proper security rules.

### Step 3: Run the Project

Since this project uses ES6 modules, you **cannot** open `index.html` directly in your browser (you'll see CORS errors). You need to run a local web server.

**Option 1: Using VS Code Live Server Extension**
1. Install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code
2. Right-click `index.html`
3. Select "Open with Live Server"

**Option 2: Using Python**
```bash
# Python 3.x
python -m http.server 8000

# Then visit http://localhost:8000
```

**Option 3: Using Node.js**
```bash
# Install http-server globally
npm install -g http-server

# Run in project directory
http-server

# Then visit http://localhost:8080
```

**Option 4: Using PHP**
```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

### Step 4: Test the Application

1. Open your browser to the local server URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`)
2. You should see the image gallery interface
3. Try uploading an image file (JPEG, PNG, GIF, or WebP under 5MB)
4. Watch the progress bar as it uploads
5. See your image appear in the gallery

## Understanding the Code

### Component Architecture

This project uses a **factory function pattern** for components:

```javascript
// Each component is a function that returns a DOM element
export function createComponent(options) {
    const element = document.createElement('div');
    // ... configure element ...
    return element;
}
```

**Benefits of this approach:**
- Simple and easy to understand
- No complex class hierarchies
- Clear inputs (parameters) and outputs (DOM elements)
- Easy to test and reuse

### Application Flow

1. **Initialization** (`app.js`)
   - Check Firebase configuration
   - Create upload form and image grid components
   - Load existing images from Firebase Storage

2. **Upload Process** (`uploadForm.js`)
   - User selects a file
   - Validate file type and size
   - Upload to Firebase Storage with progress tracking
   - Add new image to gallery on success

3. **Display Images** (`imageGrid.js`, `imageCard.js`)
   - Fetch all images from Firebase Storage
   - Create a card component for each image
   - Arrange cards in a responsive grid

### Key Concepts Demonstrated

#### 1. ES6 Modules
```javascript
// Export from a module
export function myFunction() { }

// Import in another module
import { myFunction } from './myModule.js';
```

#### 2. Async/Await
```javascript
async function loadImages() {
    try {
        const images = await listAllImages();
        // Handle images
    } catch (error) {
        // Handle error
    }
}
```

#### 3. Callbacks for Async Events
```javascript
uploadFile(file,
    (progress) => { /* Update progress bar */ },
    (error) => { /* Handle error */ },
    (data) => { /* Handle success */ }
);
```

#### 4. DOM Manipulation
```javascript
const element = document.createElement('div');
element.className = 'my-class';
element.textContent = 'Hello';
parent.appendChild(element);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Firebase not configured" error

**Solution**: Make sure you've replaced all placeholder values in `js/firebaseConfig.js` with your actual Firebase configuration.

### Problem: CORS errors in console

**Solution**: You must run the project through a web server, not by opening `index.html` directly. See "Step 3: Run the Project" above.

### Problem: "Permission denied" during upload

**Solution**: Check your Firebase Storage Rules. For development, use the test rules provided in the setup instructions.

### Problem: Images not loading

**Solution**:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Firebase Storage is enabled
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure Firebase configuration is correct

### Problem: Upload button stays disabled

**Solution**:
- Check that you're selecting a valid image file (JPEG, PNG, GIF, or WebP)
- Ensure file size is under 5MB
- Check browser console for validation errors

## Extension Challenges

Once you understand the basic application, try these challenges to extend your learning:

### Beginner Challenges
1. **Add Image Descriptions**: Allow users to add a text description when uploading
2. **Change Color Scheme**: Modify the CSS variables to create a new theme
3. **Add File Count**: Display the total number of images in the gallery
4. **Improve Empty State**: Add a more helpful empty state with instructions

### Intermediate Challenges
1. **Image Deletion**: Add a delete button to each image card
2. **Drag and Drop Upload**: Implement drag-and-drop file upload (see commented code in `uploadForm.js`)
3. **Image Filtering**: Add buttons to filter images by upload date
4. **Multiple File Upload**: Allow uploading multiple images at once
5. **Full-Screen View**: Click an image to view it full-screen

### Advanced Challenges
1. **User Authentication**: Add Firebase Authentication so each user sees only their images
2. **Image Search**: Implement search/filter functionality by filename
3. **Image Editing**: Add basic image editing (crop, rotate, filters) before upload
4. **Cloud Functions**: Use Firebase Cloud Functions for image optimization
5. **Real-time Updates**: Use Firebase Realtime Database to sync gallery across devices
